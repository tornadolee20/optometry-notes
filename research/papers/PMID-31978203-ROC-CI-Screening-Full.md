## Abstract

Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a dysfunction of binocular vision that is associated with various signs and symptoms in near work. However, CI screening is performed less frequently in adults than in children. We aimed to evaluate the ability of screening tests to discriminate CI from other binocular vision anomalies and normal binocular vision in young adults.

**Methods:** 184 university students (age, 18–28 years) who underwent an eye examination due to ocular discomfort were included. Near point of convergence (NPC), phoria, accommodative amplitude, fusional vergence, AC/A ratio, relative accommodation, binocular accommodative facility, vergence facility, and Sheard's and Percival's criteria were evaluated.

**Results:** 
- Prevalence of CI ranged from 10.3% to 21.2%
- Assessments based on NPC, Sheard's criterion, and Percival's criterion showed high discriminative ability
- Sheard's criterion showed highest diagnostic performance for CI with 3 signs

**Cut-off values:**
- NPC: >7.2 cm
- Sheard's criterion: -0.23 to 1.00
- Percival's criterion: -4.00 to -2.33

## Introduction

Non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies consist mostly of accommodative and vergence disorders. Vergence disorders are classified into:
- Convergence insufficiency (CI)
- Convergence excess
- Divergence insufficiency
- Divergence excess
- Basic esophoria
- Basic exophoria
- Fusional vergence dysfunctions

Based on phoria and the AC/A ratio.

CI is associated with symptoms including:
- Blurred vision
- Diplopia
- Discomfort during near work

Signs of CI include:
- Exophoria greater at near than at distance
- Reduced NPC
- Reduced positive fusional vergence (PFV)
- Low AC/A
- Deficiencies in NRA

## Discussion

### Key Findings:

1. **NPC is the best diagnostic test** for identifying CI
   - AUC 0.842–0.920 = excellent discriminative ability
   - Cut-off: >7.2 cm
   - Sensitivity: 1.00 in all groups

2. **Sheard's criterion is superior to NPC** for CI with 3 signs
   - Useful for distinguishing CI from other BVA
   - Works best for exophoric conditions

3. **Percival's criterion** has potential but lower discriminative ability
   - Works best for esophoric conditions
   - Needs modification for better diagnostic accuracy

4. **Prevalence of CI: 10.3% to 21.2%** (higher than general population studies showing 1.5% to 10.8%)

### Clinical Implications:

- For CI screening, use NPC + Sheard's criterion together
- NPC >7.2 cm is a strong indicator
- Sheard's criterion value >0 indicates need for intervention
- Consider both vergence AND accommodative functions in assessment

## Sheard's Criterion Calculation

**Formula:** 
```
Sheard's value = (2/3 × phoria) - (1/3 × compensating fusional vergence)
```

- If value > 0: Vergence anomaly likely (failed criterion)
- If value ≤ 0: Passes criterion
- For exophoria: Use PFV as compensating vergence
- For esophoria: Use NFV as compensating vergence

**Clinical example:**
- Near phoria: 8 exo
- PFV blur at near: 12Δ
- Sheard's = (2/3 × 8) - (1/3 × 12) = 5.33 - 4 = 1.33
- Result: >0, fails Sheard's criterion → symptomatic CI likely

---

## Percival's Criterion Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Percival's value = (1/3 × greater vergence) - (2/3 × lesser vergence)
```

- If value > 0: Vergence anomaly likely
- If value ≤ 0: Passes criterion
- Phoria should fall within middle 1/3 of vergence range
