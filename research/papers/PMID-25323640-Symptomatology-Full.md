## Abstract

### Purpose

To determine the symptoms associated with accommodative and non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions and to assess the methods used to obtain the subjects' symptoms.

### Methods

We conducted a scoping review of articles published between 1988 and 2012 that analysed any aspect of the symptomatology associated with accommodative and non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions. The literature search was performed in Medline (PubMed), CINAHL, PsycINFO and FRANCIS. A total of 657 articles were identified, and 56 met the inclusion criteria.

### Results

We found 267 different ways of naming the symptoms related to these anomalies, which we grouped into 34 symptom categories. Of the 56 studies, 35 employed questionnaires and 21 obtained the symptoms from clinical histories. We found 11 questionnaires, of which only 3 had been validated: the convergence insufficiency symptom survey (CISS V-15) and CIRS parent version, both specific for convergence insufficiency, and the Conlon survey, developed for visual anomalies in general. The most widely used questionnaire (21 studies) was the CISS V-15. Of the 34 categories of symptoms, the most frequently mentioned were: headache, blurred vision, diplopia, visual fatigue, and movement or flicker of words at near vision, which were fundamentally related to near vision and binocular anomalies.

### Conclusions

There is a wide disparity of symptoms related to accommodative and binocular dysfunctions in the scientific literature, most of which are associated with near vision and binocular dysfunctions. The only psychometrically validated questionnaires that we found (n=3) were related to convergence insufficiency and to visual dysfunctions in general and there no specific questionnaires for other anomalies.

## Introduction

In today's society, in which the emphasis on vision is associated with tasks requiring near vision, the visual system may be unable to perform this type of activity efficiently, leading to visual discomfort, fatigue or asthenopia and impaired visual performance. In many cases, the cause is an abnormality in any of the accommodative and/or vergence systems, which can lead to the development of what are termed accommodative and non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions. Accommodative and vergence dysfunctions can interfere with a child's academic progress or a person's ability to function efficiently in the course of his or her work. Children may abandon a task due to their inability to maintain adequate accommodation and/or vergence in the plane of fixation. In addition, those who perform extended periods of close vision work, such as reading or the prolonged use of computers, are more likely to report the symptoms and signs associated with these vision disorders. Nevertheless, the symptoms associated with prolonged near vision work can be reduced with the correct treatment to improve accommodative and vergence function.

These dysfunctions are commonly encountered in clinical practice and present a variety of associated symptoms, including blurred vision, difficulty in focusing at different distances, headache and ocular pain, among others. In general, all of these symptoms are categorised under the generic name of asthenopia. However, the symptoms that the patient perceives may differ depending on the type of causative disorder; it would therefore be reasonable to conclude that there are different types of asthenopia. In fact, one of the problems that clinicians face when diagnosing these dysfunctions is how to determine which symptoms are associated with each disorder and how to quantify their frequency and severity.

## Discussion

The results of this scoping review show the disparity of symptoms associated with accommodative and non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions, and that these are fundamentally related to binocular dysfunctions and mainly associated with close vision tasks. There is no consensus concerning which symptoms should be considered in the diagnosis of each of these anomalies.

CI is the dysfunction which has received most research attention; 50% of the studies analysed concerned this binocular anomaly. According to the scientific literature, CI is one of the most common anomalies of binocular vision, with prevalence values in the clinical population that range between 2.25% and 33%.

Key findings:
1. 267 different expressions to describe symptoms → grouped into 34 categories
2. Most symptoms related to near vision and binocular dysfunctions
3. Only 3 validated questionnaires exist (CISS V-15, CIRS parent, Conlon)
4. No specific questionnaires for conditions other than CI
5. Few symptoms were specific to each entity; many overlap
